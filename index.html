        <div class="subheading mb-5">Medical Lab Volunteer</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Since a little girl, joining the medical field stood out to me as a noble profession. As I was older, I learned that physicians had the capabilities and autonomy to shape their patients' lives. Strongly influenced by my mother, I knew I wanted to go into a field where I get the opportunity to help other people. I am currently a full time student at UCR interested in part time jobs or internships within the medical field to continue expanding my experience. After I receive my Bachelor's Degree in Psychology as well as fulfilling the Life Sciences Core Curriculum for pre-medical students, I have plans to apply for medical school to further my education and experience to work within the psychiatric field working with adolescents and young adults.<br><br>

        I have always been drawn to a doctor’s work and profession ever since I was a little girl. I have always been intrigued by what they do, and how they use science and their knowledge to help people with their health issues. I remember always telling my parents while growing up that I wanted to be a doctor, but I never knew what specialty or profession of health care I wanted to go into. I was constantly changing my mind about what field of medicine I wanted to go into whether that was pediatrics, OB-GYN, or oncology, you name it. That was until I read Elyn Saks’s book, The Center Cannot Hold: My Journey Through Madness. Reading a book about a woman’s journey with schizophrenia and how despite her illness, she still became a successful woman in the world held such an inspiring touch on me. <br><br>

        I was drawn to psychiatry more than a general psychologist because, in addition to talk therapy and psychoanalysis, Elyn was prescribed medication to subdue her positive symptoms of schizophrenia. People like Elyn need more than therapy to become successful, functional people in society. Psychiatrists have the qualifications and capabilities to prescribe the medication patients need to control their illnesses. Medication is a crucial part of their treatments, and sometimes patients, like Elyn, are reluctant to take the medication. They believe that by taking the medication, they are admitting “they are actually sick”. I want to be able to help patients with severe mental illnesses overcome these challenges to help them in becoming functioning people in society. In order to help such patients, I would need to become a psychiatrist rather than a general psychologist.
